# Company-Agnostic Research System - Summary of Changes

## Overview
The system has been successfully updated to be company-agnostic, reading the selling company information from the onboarding process instead of being hardcoded to "Cerebras".

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Updated CerebrasService → AIResearchService
- **File**: `backend/companies/services/cerebras_service.py`
- Renamed class from `CerebrasService` to `AIResearchService`
- Made parsing methods accept a `selling_company` parameter
- Updated prompts to use dynamic company names instead of hardcoded "Cerebras"
- Changed field names from `cerebras_analysis` to `product_analysis`

### 2. Enhanced Onboarding System
- **File**: `backend/onboarding/views.py`
- Updated `save_company_offerings()` to include company metadata
- Added `_company_info` section with: name, website, description, industry, location, employees, founded date
- Maintains both company metadata and product offerings in the same file

### 3. Updated Research Service
- **File**: `backend/companies/services/research_service.py`
- Renamed service instance from `cerebras` to `ai_service`
- Added methods to read company information from onboarding data:
  - `get_selling_company_name()`: Reads from `_company_info.name`
  - `_get_selling_context()`: Derives context from `_company_info.industry`
  - `get_product_offerings_only()`: Filters out metadata for AI processing
- Updated all service calls to pass selling company context
- Fixed file path resolution for `company_offerings.json`

### 4. Updated Perplexity Service
- **File**: `backend/companies/services/perplexity_service.py`  
- Made research methods accept `selling_company` and `selling_context` parameters
- Updated prompts to use dynamic company references instead of hardcoded "Cerebras"

### 5. Enhanced Company Offerings Structure
- **File**: `backend/companies/company_offerings.json`
- Added `_company_info` metadata section with structured company data
- Maintains product offerings as separate keys
- Example structure:
```json
{
  "_company_info": {
    "name": "Harman Kardon",
    "industry": "Automotive Audio",
    "description": "...",
    ...
  },
  "Car Audio Systems": {
    "Category": "Automotive Audio",
    "Description": "...",
    ...
  }
}
```

## Benefits Achieved

### ✅ Company Agnostic
- System now works for any company (Harman Kardon, Cerebras, or others)
- No hardcoded company names or product references
- Selling company determined from onboarding data

### ✅ Proper Data Source
- Uses structured company data from onboarding instead of regex guessing
- Reliable company name, industry, and context detection
- Maintains data integrity and consistency

### ✅ Backward Compatibility
- Falls back to regex-based detection if no metadata is available
- Graceful handling of legacy data formats
- Maintains existing API contracts

### ✅ Separation of Concerns
- Company metadata separated from product data
- Clean separation between configuration and offerings
- Easy to maintain and extend

## Test Results
All tests pass successfully:
- ✅ Correctly identifies "Harman Kardon" as selling company
- ✅ Detects "automotive audio solutions" as context
- ✅ Finds product offerings correctly
- ✅ Loads company metadata properly
- ✅ Filters product data appropriately

## Usage
The system now automatically:
1. Reads company info from onboarding data
2. Uses the correct company name in all research and outreach
3. Adapts prompts and context based on the actual selling company
4. Generates relevant prospect lists based on actual products/services

The research will now be specific to **Harman Kardon's automotive audio solutions** instead of being hardcoded to Cerebras AI infrastructure, making the system truly adaptable to any business.
